After serving two decades in the armed forces, Harrison saw a need for high-quality, dependable firearms that civilians could trust for personal protection and recreational use. Starting in a small workshop in Ladybrand, Free State,Wings Arms Dealers began by crafting bespoke firearms for local law enforcement and hunting enthusiasts.

Over the years, Wings Arms expanded its product line, incorporating advanced technology and materials to produce firearms that stand the test of time and use. By 2000, Wings Arms had grown from a local business into a respected name nationwide, renowned for its innovative designs and robust safety features.
