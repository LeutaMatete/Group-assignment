			The B&amp;T MP9 carbine is a lightweight, compact firearm developed by the Swiss company Brügger &amp; Thomet, known for its versatility and adaptability in close-quarters combat and tactical situations. Chambered in 9x19mm, the MP9 is a select-fire submachine gun that operates on a closed-bolt, blowback system, offering both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. With an extended barrel and folding stock, the carbine version provides improved accuracy over greater distances while retaining the maneuverability of a submachine gun. It features an ambidextrous safety, integrated Picatinny rails for mounting optics, lights, and lasers, and is compatible with suppressors, making it adaptable for various tactical roles. Compact and easy to handle, the MP9 carbine is favored by military and law enforcement units for its blend of high rate of fire, low recoil, and precision in close to medium-range&nbsp;engagements.

			The M14 is a semi-automatic sniper and designated marksman rifle known for its power, accuracy, and long-range capabilities. Originally developed as a battle rifle in the late 1950s, it was chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, offering considerable stopping power and an effective range of over 800 meters. Built with a gas-operated, rotating bolt system, the M14 is highly reliable in harsh environments and is effective in both semi-automatic and fully automatic (in some models) firing modes. Its solid walnut or synthetic stock, combined with an 18-22 inch barrel (depending on the model), gives it stability and accuracy at long distances. Although it was largely replaced by the M16 in the 1960s, the M14 saw resurgence as a designated marksman rifle, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to its superior range and stopping power compared to modern assault rifles. The M14 remains valued by military marksmen and law enforcement for its ruggedness and effectiveness in medium to long-range engagements.

			The AK-47 is one of the most iconic and widely used assault rifles in the world, known for its durability, simplicity, and reliability in virtually any environment. Developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the Soviet Union in 1947, the AK-47 is chambered in 7.62x39mm, providing substantial stopping power at medium ranges, with an effective range of around 300-400 meters. It operates on a gas-piston system with a rotating bolt, designed to resist jamming and function well in harsh conditions such as sand, mud, and extreme temperatures. The rifle has a 30-round detachable magazine, a full wood or synthetic stock, and iron sights, though modern versions often come with rails for mounting optics and other accessories. Its low production cost, ruggedness, and ease of maintenance have made the AK-47 a staple in military forces and paramilitary groups worldwide, as well as a symbol of resilience and resistance. Despite being over 70 years old, the AK-47 remains a powerful, reliable choice for both professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;civili
